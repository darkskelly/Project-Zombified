# Project-Zombified
A Level coursework
This is a piece of A-Level coursework created from (08/01/2021|8th of January 2021) - (01/04/2022| 1st of April 2022)
The game most likely will not be complete by the end of this deadline but I will try to finish it.
Objectives are as follows:
Zombie AI learns (Aspirational) 

After each game played or each iteration the zombie gets better and better at the game 

This idea is probably too optimistic but still a nice idea 

Zombies 
Detection 
Health  
Evolution 
Mutations 
Different Breeds of zombies 
Humans 
Health 
Skills 
Different Human Classes 
Skills for all classes 
Maps 
Procedurally generated
EXP and Levels 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Zombies
A)Detection 
If in the line of sight of a zombie, it will run directly towards human 
If outside of the line of sight but shooting zombie will ‘hear’ and run towards the noise until line of sight is established, then run towards player/human 
If a human goes round a corner a zombie will follow them if when the zombie turns the corner it still has a line of sight, if not zombie will go and try find a new target 

B)Health 
Health must go down when player shoots and hits the zombie depending on area 

C)Mutations
Zombies have a random chance of gaining a random trait such as speed or extra health every time there is a new infection 
Zombies have a chance of mutating into a different type of zombie 

D)Breeds of Zombies  
Boomers - Move slower than standard zombies, MUCH higher health than standard zombies, Special ability: Whenever in proximity of a healthy AI then the ‘boomer’ will explode and anything within a certain radius becomes infected but the boomer is used up within this 
Jumpers - Movement is increased massively, Health is lower than a standard zombie around 20-30%,  
Heavies - Movement is very slow, Health is double a boomer's health (4 times standard zombies health), Special ability: Does AOE ability which infects health AI in the proximity, can only be shot in certain areas of body 
Crawlers - Movement is very fast, half the health of a standard zombie, Special ability: Can be created by only shooting the legs of a zombie 
Berserkers - Quicker than a standard zombie, More health than a standard zombie, special ability: Once shot they will run towards you and only focus on your even if a Healthy AI is closer 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2)Humans 

A)Health 
Health must go down when a zombie ‘attacks’ a human entity 
Health can get regenerated after finding ‘health packs’ that have a chance to drop from zombies 

B)Skills 
Each human starts with randomly generated skills such as Speed, Health, Stamina  
Skills can be increased after killing a certain number of zombies or using an EXP system 
Skills will be /10 
Skills are kept throughout maps 

C)Human Classes 
Ranged class - Lightly armoured, Standard health, Special Ability: Long range high damage weapon, Higher Vision,  
Warrior Class - Medium Armoured, Slightly higher health, Special ability: Close range melee weapon with short range side arm, Can spin with weapon to do an AOE attack,  
Paladin Class - Medium Armoured, Standard health, Special ability : Can turn zombies back into humans with AOE ability also has a hammer, Can heal humans but uses up stamina for paladin   
Hunter Class - Lightly armoured, less health than stander, Weapon: Medium ranged, Special ability: Has a pet who will fight alongside Hunter class, after certain amount of levels more pets can be summoned  
Tank Class - Heavily armoured, Lots of health, Weapon: Close/medium range ,Special ability : Can take a lot more damage than a standard Human, Can stun enemies even the different breeds of zombies  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3)Skills 
Speed - Determines the movement speed of entity 
Health - Determines the Health of the entity 
Health Regeneration - Determines the Health Regeneration of an entity 
Stamina - Determines how long an entity can run for 
Dexterity - Determines how long it takes for a human to reload a gun or a zombie to charge for another attack 
Resistance - Determines how many bites a Human can take before being turned into a zombie 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4)Maps  
Open world? 
Procedurally generated 
Levels will always change and be different 
Progressively gets harder 
Set Maps 
Maps would not be the same each time 
Every time a map is played it changes the layout after  
Could have a list of layouts for the map and change between them instead of procedurally generated 
Would get harder each time  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) EXP and Levels 
Players would gain EXP throughout the levels that they play 
Progressively zombies will get harder and have higher health 
This scales with the level that a player is 
EXP goes towards the level of a class 
Different abilities unlocked by going up levels 
Zombies do not gain more special abilities as they level up, they will only get more health and have their skill points 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6) Multiplayer aspects of the game (Optimistic) 
Would be added at the end of development 
It would allow players to play as either Humans or Zombies or both! 
One player could be a zombie and one could be a Human
